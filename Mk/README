The files contained herein form a modular make-based build system.

A Makefile for use with this system is simplified: It specifies only which
kinds of product are to be built (executable or library) and sources and
compiler options for each product.  Corresponding rules are computed by the
build system; they are never specified in Makefile.

Languages & Compilers supported:
  C and C++ following GCC/Clang command-line conventions

Requirements: Either GNU Make or NetBSD Make.
